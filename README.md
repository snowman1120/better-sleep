## What is Nyxo App

Nyxo is a mobile application for improving your sleep. Its built with React Native, AWS Amplify, styled-components, and Redux. Nyxo provides the following features:

- Sleep tracking, with support for multiple different trackers
  - Google Fit
  - Apple Health
  - Oura
  - Withings
  - Fitbit
  - Polar

- Nyxo Cloud: backup your sleep data and coaching progress, and access it from [nyxo.app](https://nyxo.app)
- 4 week sleep coaching program
- Ask experts, if you have any questions we have the professional sleep coaches to help

The plan is to develop Nyxo further and allow contributions from everyone. If you want to for example build a new sleep visualization or add support for new sleep tracker, we will gladly welcome a pull request of that :)
